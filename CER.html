Coder/English/Remote

Market research:
1. Needs/Volume: How many coders want remote work, what the hurdles are, how many tramped by English?

算是半个猎头，请教下程序猿们，觉得远程加入国外的公司最大的障碍是语言，跨时区还是文化差异阿？对远程办公感兴趣的同学举个抓扔个简历阿？
以前或现在在外国远程团队的，觉得最大的障碍是什么呢？

2. Pricing: English training pricing, headhunt pricing(employee/employer), cost(teacher)（大姐/菁/瓜）
3. Education model(Group discussion/one-on-one)/Course design
