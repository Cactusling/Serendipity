Dear XXX,


This is Cici from DEDI Partners, a Chinese startup focusing on human resource redistributtion. Our most recent project is to have Chinese programmers join the superb startups remotely.

We think itâ€™s great to match the best people with the superb startup to build something we all are proud of. After related market research, we are determined to give a try partly because of the same entrepreneur spirit that inspire you to work everyday, partly because we believe it creates value.

Meanwhile, pls accept my appologies for writing to you directly as I have read your profile in XXX/ a fan of your blog.... and I know you care about this issue, and you have open mind for solution like this. With the email, here enclosed a deck introducing our services for your reference. 

So please drop us an email/note if you want to learn more about the solution/us/or pretty much anything if you are interested in Chinese market.
