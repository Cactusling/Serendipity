<p>In this lecture, Prof. Maital layouts 10 important tools for us to consider in order turn an idea to startup. Here is a summary and you may refer to the attachment for related slides. </p>

<h4>Value,cost,price</h4>

<p>To determine whether your idea has business and economic viability, you only need 3 numbers. The numbers you need are first value, second cost, and third price.

Take your idea, do a prototype,an example, a sample webpage. Always good to have something tangible to show to people. And then present it to a client and ask the client whether they'd like it, whether they'd buy it, whether they'd use it and what they'd be willing to pay for your product.Step two is to try to estimate the cost of the resources it will take in order to deliver the value to your client or your customer. Variable costs, meaning production costs, operating costs, and fixed costs, meaning the overhead not related to the actual units that you produce. The difference between value and cost is what I call the social margin. The last number we need is the price. And when you set the price, essentially, you share this social margin that you're creating, between yourself and your company's shareholders, and between the client, the customer. So the difference between value and price is the client margin, the benefit the client gets where the value they receive exceeds the price and the value of the dollars, or the money they give up to get it.
